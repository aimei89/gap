Custom Kernel Modules for GAP
=============================

These modules are a little out of date, but at one time supported the
radios on GAP.

gapspi.ko
---------

This module uses SPI0 and the onboard demux to switch the SPI bus and 
single chip select to multiple peripherals.


nrf51822.ko
-----------

This provides a SPI connection to the nRF51822.
