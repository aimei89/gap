CC2520 Linux Kernel Module Manual
=================================
The purpose of this manual is to describe the basic operations of the
CC2520 linux kernel module. It should give you an idea of how to use it,
the current caveats, and maybe how to extend it.

Introduction
------------
The motivations behind the development of this driver are to enable an
embedded linux system to run a full 802.15.4 radio stack without the
addition of a dedicated coprocessor to handle timing critical operations.
The idea is that this will give us the maximal flexibility, while still
being mindful of things like keeping the component count low. We chose
to use the cc2520 radio because it's reasonably new, offering small
performance and interface improvements over it's predecessor, the cc2420, 
which has enjoyed a long run of successful applications.

The reason that coprocessors have traditionally been employed in the use
of low-power 802.15.4 radios has been to meet the strict timing guarantees
and to allow for reuse of code that runs on the motes. If the basestation
is running the same exact networking stack as the motes they are
likely to work together. The coprocessor has taken the form of an additional
wireless sensor mote attached via a serial link to the Linux-powered base
station. 

During the development of this module we discovered that many of the
functions traditionally required to be performed by a coprocessor can
instead be performed within a kernel module. We can achieve
microsecond-resolution timing using the latest hr_timers and the kernel
APIs for gpio interrupts and asynchronous SPI transactions have reached
a point of maturity. 

Overview
--------
This driver implements a complete interface for the CC2520 radio. It's
low-level enough that it can be used to build a variety of IP or other
solutions in user-land. Decisions on what to include in the feature set
were made by examining two criteria, first what was strictly necessary
from a timing standpoint, and second what made sense from a standpoint of
being self-contained and feature-complete.

By exposing a character driver it becomes quite easy to get up and running
quickly. This manual is designed as supporting documentation to make it
easy to dive into the advanced configuration and usage scenarios possible
and give a cursory overview of the driver's layout to make it easier to
extend. 

Configuration
-------------
All run-time configuration of the driver is done using ioctls from the calling
process. You can find the complete definition of the available ioctls in
<code>ioctl.h</code> and I recommend you check there for the most up-to-date
information.

For information on the exact mechanics of performing ioctls please see some
of the reference information I've included. 

Default Configuration
---------------------
By default the radio is configured to be interoperable with standard TinyOS
radio stacks. It's configured with most optional features turned on. Feature
parameters can be found in <code>cc2520.h</code> and are set by default as follows:

```
// Defaults for Radio Operation
#define CC2520_DEF_CHANNEL 26
#define CC2520_DEF_RFPOWER 0x32 // 0 dBm
#define CC2520_DEF_PAN 0x22
#define CC2520_DEF_SHORT_ADDR 0x01
#define CC2520_DEF_EXT_ADDR 0x01

// All these timing parameters are in microseconds.
#define CC2520_DEF_ACK_TIMEOUT 2500 
#define CC2520_DEF_MIN_BACKOFF 320
#define CC2520_DEF_INIT_BACKOFF 4960
#define CC2520_DEF_CONG_BACKOFF 2240
#define CC2520_DEF_CSMA_ENABLED true

// We go for around a 1% duty cycle of the radio
// for LPL stuff. 
#define CC2520_DEF_LPL_WAKEUP_INTERVAL 512000
#define CC2520_DEF_LPL_LISTEN_WINDOW 5120
#define CC2520_DEF_LPL_ENABLED true
```

These parameters are better explained in the relevant feature sections below
and correspond to the members of the ioctl data structures.

Character Driver Interface
--------------------------
The radio presents itself using a standard Linux character driver. This decision
was made because character drivers are conceptually simple, reasonably performant,
and easy to program against. We do bend the rules of the character driver
interface however. Deviations are as follows:

  * We require that only entire packets are written or read from the 
character driver. You may not write partial packets to the driver, and
you should always call read with a buffer that is 128 bytes or large to
allow for the maximum possible frame size, and length byte. 
  * The read call will always try to write exactly a single packet to
the user buffers. If you provide inadequate  buffer space for the maximum
packet size it will overrun.
  * We define some custom error codes to indicate a busy channel and
other radio specific error codes.
  * **Our driver is not fully thread-safe.** Although you can certainly
send and receive packets simultaneously (this is recommended), you may
not send multiple packets simultaneously from separate threads. Only a 
single packet may be sent or received at any time from all processes. 
  * Our driver does not implement nonblocking IO currently. The low
data rates really don't make this something we need to do, although
it might be supported in the future. 

**<code>write()</code> Calls**

Calling write with a data frame as specified below will return in most
cases the length of the data written, as typical of Linux character
drivers. It will never perform an incomplete write, but the maximum
buffer size that is allowable is 128 bytes, 1 byte for the PHY length
field, and 127 for the MAC datagram. 

The write call will block until the entire transmission has been
completed by the radio. This can be 10s of milliseconds depending
on how you configure radio features such as LPL.

When the write call returns the caller should examine the return
value. If it is negative this indicates an error in transmission
and should be handled appropriately. The error codes are listed
below. 

**Error Codes**

The following error codes can be returned from calls to <code>write</code>:

  * **CC2520_TX_SUCCESS**- The packet was transmitted successfully.
  * **CC2520_TX_BUSY**- The channel was busy and the packet was unable to
be transmitted.
  * **CC2520_TX_ACK_TIMEOUT** - The packet was sent but the receive did not
send an ACK within the timeout period.
  * **CC2520_TX_FAILED** - A general error has occurred.

**<code>read()</code> Calls**

Calling read will block indefinitely until a packet arrives. When a packet
does arrive it will write the packet to the specified buffer and return the
length of the packet.

Because receive is only valid when an appropriate packet has been received
it has no error codes. Read should always be called with a 128 byte buffer.

Frame Format
------------
We use pseudo-802.15.4 frames for this radio that preserve some of the
radio-specific information that is likely to be useful for building
applications. 

The radio automatically computes the CRC on the way out, and when
receiving packets will replace the CRC with metadata related to 
packet reception.

**Sending Frame Format**

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Bytes</th>
		<th>Title</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>Length</td>
		<td>The entire length of the packet, including 2 CRC bytes, 
			but excluding the length byte itself.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>FCF</td>
		<td>Frame control sequence, ACK bit will be checked.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>DSN</td>
		<td>Incrementing data sequence number, used to filter duplicate frames. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>multiple</td>
		<td>Address Info</td>
		<td>Depending on the FCF bits, this will contain some variation of PAN-ID and short
			or extended addresses for the source and destination.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>multiple</td>
		<td>Payload</td>
		<td>The MAC payload goes next.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

**Note**: The radio WILL compute a CRC checksum automatically and append this information to
the outgoing frame. You must specify a length that includes the CRC checksum, but exclude it
from the packet itself. 

**Receiving Frame Format**

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Bytes</th>
		<th>Title</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>Length</td>
		<td>The entire length of the packet, including 2 CRC bytes, 
			but excluding the length byte itself.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>FCF</td>
		<td>Frame control sequence, ACK bit will be checked.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>DSN</td>
		<td>Incrementing data sequence number, used to filter duplicate frames. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>multiple</td>
		<td>Address Info</td>
		<td>Depending on the FCF bits, this will contain some variation of PAN-ID and short
			or extended addresses for the source and destination.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>multiple</td>
		<td>Payload</td>
		<td>The MAC payload goes next.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>Packet Metadata</td>
		<td>The final two bytes includes a bit indicating whether the checksum was correct,
			7-bits dedicated to RSSI and a byte dedicated to LQI. See the CC2520's datasheet
			for more information. </td>
	</tr>
</table>

Please see the original MAC specification for more information on how to set the FCF
fields for different addressing modes. 

Carrier Sense Multi-Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)
--------------------------------------------------------
CSMA/CA is a feature that allows for the driver to sense the current channel
energy level, and intelligently wait to send a packet until the channel is clear,
avoiding potential collisions.

It is configured using three parameters via the <code>CC2520_IO_RADIO_SET_CSMA</code> 
ioctl. It should only be configured when the radio is off. 

  * <code>min_backoff</code>- The minimum back off period, in microseconds, the radio
will use.
  * <code>init_backoff</code>- The maximum back off period, in microseconds, the radio
will use when initially sending a message. 
  * <code>cong_backoff</code>- The maximum back off period, in microseconds, the radio
will use when it has detected congestion in the channel.
  * <code>enabled</code>- Whether CSMA is enabled or disabled. 

The way CSMA operates is by introducing a random amount of delay into each transmitted
packet. It does this both when congestion is detected, and more unintuitively, before
the first transmission as well. It introduces random delay in the first transmission
in order to prevent multiple motes from transmitting simultaneously in situations
where they are all responding to a single broadcast message. 

CSMA will choose a random backoff period bounded between the <code>min_backoff</code>
and <code>init_backoff</code> values for initial transmission, and between the 
<code>min_backoff</code> and <code>cong_backoff</code> values for a second transmission
when the driver detects congestion.

The initial backoff period should always be smaller than the congestion backoff period.
This give priority to motes that aren't continuously transmitting packets.

In cases where CSMA is unable to transmit the packet due to congestion within two retries
it will return an error code, which bubbles up to the system write call. The error is
defined in cc2520.h as <code>-CC2520_TX_BUSY</code>

Software Acknowledgment (Soft-ACK)
----------------------------------
Soft-ACK allows the radio to acknowledge packets from within the software stack,
instead of traditional hardware acknowledgment. This is useful because it gives
the acknowledgment a slightly better guarantee than hardware acknowledgments do.
It allows for the sender to confirm that the packet has made it through the
software layers as well as the hardware layers of the radio. This is important
because in some edge cases the software will have to drop a received packet
although the radio has successfully received it. 

Software acknowledgments are controlled by a single ioctl parameter. This
parameter is the timeout, in microseconds, that the driver will wait for
other radios to send an acknowledgment. It defaults to 2.5ms. 

Soft-ACK is always enabled, but acknowledgment is controlled on a per-packet
basis. Check the 802.15.4 MAC frame control field (FCF) header for more
information on how to request software acknowledgments on an individual packet.
The driver will always acknowledge packets received requesting an acknowledgment.

**TODO:** In the future it would be wise to modify the default behavior to only
accept packets if they are successfully read by the character driver <code>read</code>
function call.

Low Power Listening (LPL)
-------------------------
In order to extend the battery life of motes with limited amounts of energy available
a technique called low power listening has been employed. This technique effectively
duty-cycles receiving radios, periodically waking them up for a fraction of the time
they would typically be awake for, checking for active transmissions, and then going
back to sleep.

This technique is effective because idly listening for a message consumes almost as
much power as sending does, but happens much more often. By reducing the time
the mote spends listening for a packet to a small percentage of the total time
significant power savings are realized, with only a marginal loss of perceived
responsiveness. 

The tradeoff involves shifting the energy burden to the transmitting side of the
radio, by continuously retransmitting the packet over the entire period the receiver
radio could be sleeping.

Our radio does support LPL. An ioctl supports enabling/disabling this feature as
well as setting a number of key parameters that determine how long the mote will
send for. These parameters are documented below:

  * <code>window</code>- The amount of time, in microseconds, that the receiving
mote will wake up for and listen for data. The mote will most likely wake up and
sample for channel energy repeatedly during this interval. It should be longer
than the software-ack timeout period.
  * <code>interval</code>- The amount of time, in microseconds, that the receiving
mote will sleep between wakeup windows. Together with the window these two 
parameters make up the duty-cycle of the receiving mote.
  * <code>enabled</code>- Whether LPL is enabled or not. 

Keep in mind that the parameters you set here should match those set in the motes.
They are only used to determine the length of time that the radio should attempt to
retransmit the packet for a single LPL period in order to ensure with a reasonable
certainty that a receiving mote will wake up and receive it. 

LPL can have a significant impact on performance in certain situations. When used
with software acknowledgments, which are enabled on all non-broadcast packets, and
sent to a mote that is not configured with LPL it will have negligible performance
impact. The mote will immediately ACK the first received packet and this will
conclude the LPL sending session, causing no resends. However, when sending packets
to the broadcast address LPL will significantly reduce packet rate. Because there
is no mechanism to ACK broadcast packets, the packet will be resent for the entire
LPL send period. In these situations it is recommended to either switch to a
non-broadcast address, or to disable LPL. 

Sending/Receiving Data
----------------------
Generally the best way to setup a user application for interaction with this
radio is to create two dedicated threads for sending and receiving data, and
implement in/out buffering in your application. The driver itself does not 
buffer any packets, it will only hold the most recently received packet and
only keeps buffers for transmitting a single packet at a time. It will drop
packets received when there isn't a blocking read() call pending data, and
it will fail (perhaps catastrophically) if multiple write operations occur.

I suggest two threads with a threading model that looks something like this:

**Send Thread:** 

Waits for signal from the main thread. This signal indicates
that there is a new packet to be transmitted in a shared thread-safe FIFO queue.
Wakes up and calls write() with the packet, waits for the driver to return. After
the driver finishes transmitting this thread examines the error code and takes
appropriate action, including scheduling callbacks that handle successful or failed
transmissions on the main thread. Finally this thread will loop and check the FIFO 
queue for another packet to send and wait for a flag from the main thread.

**Receive Thread:** 

Calls read() immediately and blocks on the radio receiving a new packet. Upon
read() reading this thread will add the data to a shared, thread-safe, FIFO queue
and signal the main thread that data is available. It will immediately proceed to
wait again on read().

Laying out your system in this way should achieve decent data rates, while not
consuming excessive resources.

Turning the Radio On/Off
------------------------
Turning the radio on and off also occurs using ioctls. You may not turn the radio
off while actively transmitting or receiving a packet, doing so is not considered
thread-safe. 

Portability
------------

**Platform Portability:**
This module directly interfaces a CC2520 radio with linux. It is tested
on the Raspberry Pi board, but uses standard kernel abstractions
(specifically gpios, hr_timers, and spi_devices) so it should be easily
ported to any other platform. The biggest problem will probably be maintaining
the strict timing guarantees this module implicitly requires of the underlying
system.

For example it relies on the SPI driver executing with a real-time queue,
any looser timing will result in potentially out of order execution of SPI
commands, or interweaving with interrupt handles that are implicitly required
to occur after certain bus transactions have completed. 

For help getting this code working on a different platform feel free to
shoot me an e-mail.

**Radio Portability:**
Most of this code should also be reasonably radio portable. We intentionally
avoided employing too many abstractions with regards to the low-level
implementation of the radio itself. This keeps in line with the philosophy
seen in other linux kernel modules. We focus on a concise implementation
that is easy to understand, avoiding the alternative which is an extremely
generic system that only the original author can extend. 

That being said almost all radio-specific functionality is contained within
<code>radio.c</code>. As long as your radio can generate interrupts upon
the start of a transmission, and the reception of packet, you should be good
to go. 

This code could easily be modified to support other radios out there, including
the CC2420 (trivially), and the RF230 by Atmel.
